This project utilizes a graph-based neural network for predicting strain and stress in layered materials. The approach involves data preprocessing, dataset generation, graph formation, and training deep learning models to analyze material behavior.

The project contains the following key files:

main.py - The main script to train and evaluate the model.
data_preprocessing.py - Handles filtering and preprocessing of material data.
dataset_generation.py - Generates synthetic datasets for training and validation.
graph_formation.py - Constructs graph-based representations of data.
train_nn.py - Trains a neural network for stress and strain prediction.
train_GNN.py - Contains the training loop for graph-based learning.
eval_strain.py - Evaluates the performance of the model using various metrics.
model.py - Defines the architecture of the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Graph Attention Network (GAT).

To train the model

Download the frame_large_path dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jdqzxtWYaD6kauOPkwVkGCuL7iV14o_8/view?usp=drive_link and copy it to the data folder (PIML/training/data).

Download the section_path dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A0mF4MpVF0N1zlPWxg8BFn4LPhnoTJnk/view?usp=drive_link and copy it to the data folder (PIML/training/data).

Clone https://github.com/egemenokte/3DLayeredElastic.git into the PIML/training/ and rename it to LayeredElastic (PIML/training/LayeredElastic)
